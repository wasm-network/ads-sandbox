# Ad Viewer

The AdViewer is found in the samples module. It provides a user interface to see how ad animation is presented in
different ad sizes. A toolbar at the top of the screen shows the different ad sizes that are available, which are the
ones defined in the `AD_SIZES_MAP` in `/samples/mod.rs`. When creating an ad, the prototype size is 500x500 even though
that isn't a common ad size. When you select another ad size, the ad will change dimensions and the content within the
ad will adjust accordingly.
